This app uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript to incorporate the New York Times' API Top Stories duing the COVID-19 era. The app is split up by a carousel to categorize the different types of top stories, from the homde default, health, and art. This project was extremely helpful and was a great learning experience to incorporate everyting I've learned so far in the SEI course into one project. I appreciate the freedom to focus on a project topic of my choice. Some challenges I had were: not being able to do everything I had intially planned to do, debug, and implement a carousel with images and text. Somethings I found helfpul: creating a schedule for myself with goals and detailed tasks I wanted to get done by the project deadline, starting with the logic first and then focusing on styling, finding an API that interested me and I wanted to work with took a lot longer so having backups was defintely helpful.
