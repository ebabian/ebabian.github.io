PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This app uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript to incorporate the New York Times' API Top Stories duing the COVID-19 era. The app is split up by a carousel to categorize the different types of top stories, from the home default, health, and art. I came up with this idea since my family doesn't have any interest in reading or watching the news so I thought it'd be a fun idea to create an app that is user friendly and is sensitive to what visuals are being shown. I have a background in photography and I have worked for well known photographers and magazines like TIMES and the New Yorker so I was excited to integrate my interest in tech and art to enhance the act of storytelling. 

WHAT WAS HELPFUL?
This project was extremely helpful and was a great learning experience to incorporate everyting I've learned so far in the SEI course into one project. I appreciate the freedom to focus on a project topic of my choice. I took Matt's suggestion to create a schedule for myself and I split up goals I wanted to achieve every day, which created a great structure for me. I also started with the logic first and then focused on styling, which helped me prioritize the functionality of the app. Find an API that interested me and I wanted to work with took a lot longer so having backups was defintely helpful.

CHALLENGES? 
Some challenges I had were: not being able to do everything I had intially planned to do, debug, and implement a carousel with images and text. 

WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD MORE TIME?
Initially I wanted this app to have one image work with the API from a news site that was focused on COVID-19 articles, the second images to relocate the user to a website that described how to make a mask at home and the third image would be focused on fundraisers/ a list of organization ppl can donate through the site charity navigator. However, I didn't have enough time to do all of that so I had to readjust my goals to be practical for my level.
